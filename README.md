# ParserMicroC
The object of the elaboration was to parse the Microc language and to insert the appropriate semantic actions that enabled insertion into the identifier symbol table. 
In addition, if an identifier has not been declared, when used in an operation, an exception is issued that indicates the first encountered variable that is not present in the symbol table.
